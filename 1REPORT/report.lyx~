\begin_layout Title
Exploring the Dynamical Behaviour of Spin Waves Through Energy-Absorption
 Interferometry

\begin_layout Author

\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Energy absorbtion interferometry can be used to find the natural dynamical
 modes of a system of interacting magnetic dipoles, using only measurements
 of total absorbed power.
 Previously used to investigate interacting electric dipoles, it is a general
 technique based on the physics of partially coherent energy absorbtion

, and theoretically applied to systems of interacting magnetic dipoles.
 Simulations based on the discrete dipole approximation (DDA) are shown
 illustrating this in practice and are used to explore the complex and fascinati
ng world of spin waves and spintronic devices.

As an older example of how quickly developments in this area influence the
 technology sector, the giant magnetoresistive effect (GMR) was discovered
 in 1988 (leading to the award of the 2007 Nobel Prize in Physics) and was
 demonstrated in a hard disk drive read head by 1994 and commercialized
 shortly thereafter.
 Between the introduction of the first hard disk drive in 1956 to 2007,
 there was a 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{10^{8}}$
\end_inset

 increase in magnetic recording density.
 This progress depends on decreasing the magnetic grain sizes, but demanding
 problems must be solved as nanoscale sized structures are reached - inevitably
 leading to a desire for greater understanding of the fundamental physics
 involved

Spin Waves
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fundamentally, magnetism arises from the Pauli exclusion principle coupling
 electron orbitals to spin states.
 This exchange interaction can be phenomologically wirtten by treating atoms
 as directly coupled dipoles, or as a mean field in the rigid band model
 of metals

 Spin waves are coherent excitations of these magnetic dipoles, with scale
 lengths from

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At low frequencies they are mediated by dipole-dipole interactions and at
 high frequencies exchange interactions.
 They can be created by applying a large static field and a small time varying
 field to a magnetic material - the static field causes the dipoles to align,
 or at least form domains, and the time-varying field causes excitations.
 They may also be excited thermally by phonons (central to understanding
 the destruction of magnetic order, of key importance in magnetic storage
 media), or by visible or radio frequency photons, allowing for experimental
 investigation

 For a more visual picture we may use a semi-classical model in which the
 dipoles precess on the surfaces of cones about the direction of the applied
 field.
 The low-lying elementary excitations have successive spins advanced in
 phase by a constant angle, giving the form of a disturbance that propagates
 as a wave

A recent advance is the development of processes to create magnetic nanoparticle
s with control of sizes and shapes, leading to novel technological applications.
 The determination of their normal modes and ability to control them has
 important technological implications, since read head size is fundamentally
 limited by spin-wave noise which could be reduced by suitable design choices

Measurement of very small samples can be challenging due to the amount of
 material.
 A number of techniques are commonly used to investigate general magnetic
 properties, including: SQUID magnetometers, x-ray magnetic circular dichroism
 (XMCD), using the magnetoopic Kerr effect (MOKE) and other novel techniques.
 More direct investigation of the spin wave dynamics may be achieved through
 the Brillon light scattering and ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) techniques

\begin_layout Standard
Ferromagnetic resonance, one of the most useful contempary techniques, is
 at microwave frequencies similar in principle to nuclear spin resonance
 (NMR).
 In a strong applied magnetic field spins precess and transverse radio frequency
 (RF) energy is abosorbed dependent on the relation between precession and
 applied frequencies.
 The field strength is varied and absorbances to the small RF probe are
 measured.
 In a ferromagnetic sample, the transverse susceptibility is large and the
 strong exchange coupling tends to supress dipolar contributions so resonance
 lines may be quite sharp

Energy Absorption Interferometry

Energy Absorption Interferometry (EAI) is a technique first proposed in
 the context of electric dipoles and is a general technique for studying
 modes based on the physics of coherent energy absorption

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The general setup is similar to FMR, with the structure under test placed
 in a large static magnetic field, but rather than one source, a pair of
 phase-locked time-varying sources - say magnetic dipoles - are used to
 probe the system.
 The total power absorbed is measured as a function of the phase difference
 between the sources, giving a fringe.
 The complex visibility of this fringe is measured for pairs of source locations
, using which the technique is able to reconstruct the dynamical modes and
 their relative responsivities.
 Furthermore, the technique may be repeated for a range of applied field
 strengths, yeilding a huge amount of useful information about the system.
 Degenerate excitation may be found, giving information about system symmetries.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One fundamental advantage of the technique is that only the total absorbed
 power needs to be measured, making this applicable to a large number of
 systems, like the previously demonstrated electric dipoles

\begin_layout Subsection
In Practice
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
EAI may be implemented in a number of ways.
 A illustrative example is shown in the figure.
 A thin sample is supported by a thermally isolated Si membrane, and bolometer
 technology is used to very sensitively measure the absorbed power.
 This is placed in a large static magnetic field from a DC solenoid and
 illuminated by a pair of phase-locked magnetic sources which are rotated
 around the periphery, exciting spin waves.
 In practice these sources might simply be slightly offset in frequency
 and the oscillation of power absorption measured to find the phase.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the purposes of its reconstruction, the system is treated as a discrete
 set of magnetic dipoles, which may be fundamental excitations or elements
 of the discrete dipole approximation (DDA), a versatile technique often
 used to model scattering.

We shall model the system as a discrete system of magnetic dipoles 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 This may be done for any system using the discrete dipole approximation
 (DDA) - the equation then represents averages over finite macroscopic regions.
 A single dipole with magnetic dipole moment 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{{\bf m_{j}}}$
\end_inset

 will evolve according the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{d{\bf {m_{j}}}}{dt}=-\gamma_{j}\mu_{0}{\bf {m_{j}}}\times{\bf {H}}_{j}^{tot}+\frac{\alpha_{j}}{|{\bf {m_{j}}}|}({\bf {m_{j}}}\times\frac{{d{\bf {m_{j}}}}}{dt})
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 is an index which specifies a dipole, 
\begin_inset Formula ${\bf H}_{j}^{tot}$
\end_inset

 is the total magnetic field at the dipole, 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{j}$
\end_inset

 is the gyromagnetic ratio of the dipole (positive and negative values correspon
ding to opposite rotation directions) and 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{j}$
\end_inset

 is a phenomenological damping coefficient (in FMR, for the transverse component
s of the dynamic part of the magnetization).
 This equation could be generalized to a Bloch equation with different longitudi
nal and transverse dampings but this will not be done to simplify the analysis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We move to the steady state by writing 
\begin_inset Formula ${\bf H}_{j}^{tot}={\bf H}_{j}^{tot\,(0)}+{\bf H}_{j}^{tot\,(t)}$
\end_inset

 which represent the non-time dependent and time dependent terms, provided
 by the large static field and the smaller RF sources respectively.
 Thus when only the static field is present, the system equilibrates into
 a state 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{{\bf m_{j}}}^{(0)}$
\end_inset

 with no torque on dipoles (from LLG).
 Generally, the dipoles can form non-aligned domains but we assume they
 are in the saturated state: all totally aligned with the static field,
 so 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{{\bf m_{j}}}^{(0)}=m^{s}\hat{{\bf k}}$
\end_inset

 (the saturated magnetization), and 
\begin_inset Formula ${\bf H}^{tot(0)}\equiv H^{0}\hat{{\bf k}}\approx{\bf H}^{ext(0)}$
\end_inset

.
 We also make the vital assumption that in the steady state, all of the
 absorbed (or indeed extracted) power is transferred from substrate (physically,
 its phonon system).

\begin_inset Formula ${\bf H}_{j}^{tot\,(t)}=\mathrm{Re}\left\{ {\bf H}_{j}^{tot\,(1)}e^{-i\omega t}\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 Substituting into LLG and discarding non-linear terms (effectively the
 approximation 
\begin_inset Formula ${\bf m_{j}}\cdot{\bf \hat{k}}\approx{\bf m_{j}}^{(0)}$
\end_inset

, the static component is much greater than the parallel dynamical component)
 we get:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
i\frac{\omega}{\gamma\mu_{0}}{\bf m}^{(1)}=m^{s}\hat{{\bf k}}\times{\bf H}^{tot\,(1)}+{\bf m}^{(1)}\times H^{0}\hat{{\bf k}}+i\frac{\omega\alpha}{\gamma\mu_{0}}\hat{{\bf k}}\times{\bf m}^{(1)}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Non-Interacting Case
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We may invert the above equation to write the susceptibility of a system
 of non-interacting, precessing dipoles with position vectors 
\begin_inset Formula ${\bf r}_{0j}$
\end_inset

 as:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\overline{\overline{\boldsymbol{\chi}}}_{L}({\bf r})=\sum_{j}\frac{\gamma_{j}\mu_{0}m_{j}^{s}\omega}{(\omega_{0j}^{2}-\omega^{2})-i\omega\Gamma_{j}}\overline{\overline{\textrm{\ensuremath{\boldsymbol{S}}}}}_{j}\delta(\boldsymbol{r-\boldsymbol{r_{0j}}})\label{eq:localx}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\overline{\overline{\boldsymbol{{\bf S}}}}_{j}=\frac{\omega_{0j}}{\omega}\boldsymbol{\hat{i}\hat{i}}+i\boldsymbol{\hat{j}\hat{i}}-i\boldsymbol{\hat{i}\hat{j}}+\frac{\omega_{0j}}{\omega}\boldsymbol{\hat{j}\hat{j}},\quad S_{j}=\left(\begin{array}{cc}
\omega_{0}/\omega & -i\\
i & \omega_{0}/\omega
\end{array}\right)
\]

\end_inset

 where we have used dyadics and 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{j}$
\end_inset

 is the matrix form (see appendix for detail).
 The 
\begin_inset Formula ${\bf m}_{j}^{(1)}$
\end_inset

 are time independent in the plane perpendicular to 
\begin_inset Formula ${\bf H}^{(0)}$
\end_inset

.
 The natural frequency of precession is 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{0j}=\gamma_{j}\mu_{0}H_{j}^{(0)}$
\end_inset

 and the damping rate is 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma_{j}=2\alpha_{j}\omega_{0j}$
\end_inset

, and we have assumed low loss (small 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{j}$
\end_inset

).
 Now spatial dipole moment is 
\begin_inset Formula ${\bf M}^{(1)}({\bf r})=\overline{\overline{\chi}}_{L}({\bf r})\cdot{\bf H}^{ext(1)}({\bf r})$
\end_inset

, with no spatial integral or 
\begin_inset Formula ${\bf r'}$
\end_inset

 dependence, as the non-interacting case is totally local.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The natural modes of the isolated dipole are found from the eigenvectors
 and eigenvalues (diagonalisation) of 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\overline{{\bf S}}}$
\end_inset

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
{\bf u}_{+}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\hat{{\bf i}}+i\hat{{\bf j}}),\quad\lambda_{+}=\frac{\omega_{0}}{\omega}+1
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
{\bf u}_{-}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\hat{{\bf i}}-i\hat{{\bf j}}),\quad\lambda_{-}=\frac{\omega_{0}}{\omega}-1
\]

\end_inset

 corresponding respectively to rotation in the the natural precession direction,
 and in the reverse direction,.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Interacting Case
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can write 
\begin_inset Formula ${\bf H}_{j}^{tot}={\bf H}_{j}^{ext}+{\bf H}_{j}^{xch}+{\bf H}_{j}^{dip}$
\end_inset

 where the terms represent the applied external field on the system, the
 effective field from exchange interactions between dipoles, and the scattered
 field from the other dipoles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The exchange interaction effective field at a dipole can be written as:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
{\bf H}_{j}^{xch}=J\sum_{k=NN}{\bf m}_{k}\label{eq:exchange}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 where NN indicates the nearest neighbors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The dipole scattering term is:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
{\bf H}^{dip(1)}({\bf r)}=\int\overline{\overline{{\bf G}}}({\bf r},{\bf r'})\cdot{\bf M}^{(1)}({\bf r'})d{\bf r'}
\]

\end_inset

 using the non-retarded magnetostatic greens dyadic (reference????):
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\overline{\overline{{\bf G}}}({\bf r},{\bf r'})=\frac{1}{R^{3}}\left(3\frac{{\bf RR}}{R^{2}}-\overline{\overline{{\bf I}}}\right),\quad{\bf R}={\bf r}-{\bf r'},\quad R=|{\bf R}|\label{eq:magnetostatic}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We may now combine these terms and the non interacting susceptibility to
 give:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
{\bf H}^{ext(1)}({\bf r}_{i})=\sum_{j}\overline{\overline{{\bf T}}}_{ji}\cdot{\bf H}^{tot(1)}({\bf r}_{j})\label{eq:tdef}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\overline{\overline{{\bf T}}}_{ij}=\overline{\overline{{\bf I}}}\delta_{ij}-\frac{\gamma_{i}\mu_{0}m_{i}^{s}\omega}{(\omega_{0i}^{2}-\omega^{2})-i\omega\Gamma_{i}}\left\{ J\delta_{i,NN}\overline{\overline{{\bf S}}}_{i}+(1-\delta_{ij})\overline{\overline{{\bf G}}}({\bf r}_{j},{\bf r}_{i})\cdot\overline{\overline{{\bf S}}}_{i}\right\} 
\]

\end_inset

which can be written as a matrix equation in the dipole locations, and inverted
 to give the total field at each dipole in terms of the applied field.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Power Absorption
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since EAI uses power absorption measurements, calculation of them is needed.
 In the explicitly time dependent and real case, the instantaneous power
 absorption is:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P(t)=\mu_{0}\int{\bf H}({\bf r},t)\cdot\frac{\partial{\bf M}({\bf r},t)}{\partial t}d^{3}{\bf r}
\]

\end_inset

 Using the definition of non-local susceptibility,
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
{\bf M}({\bf r})=\int\overline{\overline{\boldsymbol{\chi}}}({\bf r},{\bf r'})\cdot{\bf H}({\bf r'})d^{3}{\bf r'}
\]

\end_inset

the time average power absorption is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{multline}
P(\nu)=\frac{\omega}{2}\mu_{0}\mathrm{Im}\varint_{V}{\bf H}^{*}({\bf r})\cdot{\bf M}({\bf r})d^{3}{\bf r}=\frac{\omega}{2}\mu_{0}\mathrm{Im}\varint_{V}\varint_{V}{\bf H}^{*}({\bf r})\cdot\overline{\overline{\boldsymbol{\chi}}}({\bf r},{\bf r'})\cdot{\bf H}({\bf r'})d^{3}{\bf r}d^{3}{\bf r'}
\end{multline}

\end_inset

 over the volume of the sample, 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

, since the susceptibility elsewhere is zero.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For our system of dipoles we thus find a power absorption:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
P(\nu)=\sum_{j}\frac{\gamma_{j}\mu_{0}^{2}m_{j}^{s}}{2}\left[\frac{\omega\Gamma_{j}}{\omega^{2}(\frac{\omega_{0j}^{2}}{\omega^{2}}-1)^{2}+\Gamma_{j}^{2}}\right]\times{\bf H}_{j}^{tot(1)*}\cdot\overline{\overline{{\bf S}_{j}}}\cdot{\bf H}_{j}^{tot(1)}\label{eq:checkpower}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 If the system is rotationally excited, 
\begin_inset Formula ${\bf H}^{tot(1)}({\bf r}_{i})=a{\bf u}_{\pm}$
\end_inset

, the absorbed power will be
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
<P(a{\bf u}_{\pm})>=\frac{1}{2}a^{2}\Gamma\gamma\mu_{0}^{2}m_{s}\frac{\omega(\omega_{0}/\omega\pm1)}{\omega^{2}(\omega_{0}^{2}/\omega^{2}-1)^{2}+\Gamma^{2}}
\]

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We see from the numerator that the power is always positive for rotation
 with the natural precession direction, and reaches a peak at 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega=\omega_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 However, for the opposite direction rotations, the power is zero at 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega=\omega_{0}$
\end_inset

, and work may be done by the system for 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega>\omega_{0}$
\end_inset

, taking energy out of the dipole.
 Physically the steady state case makes perfect sense for the natural precession
 rotation direction rotation - however here our assumption of steady state
 is called into question - the negative power modes would be quickly damped
 by the applied field removing the energy in an experiment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In practice, there is nothing wrong with this - modes fall into two separable
 subsets with opposite rotation directions - there are no mixed modes.
 The negative power absorption modes would however be much more difficult
 to detect experimentally due to this rapid damping effect, but we are not
 generally interested in them either.
 We focus on the positive absorption, natural precession direction modes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
EAI
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After a number of steps from the above forms for the power we may arrive
 at the most useful form: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
<P(\nu)>=\frac{\omega}{2}\mu_{0}\varint_{V}\varint_{V}\overline{\overline{{\bf C}}}^{tot}({\bf r},{\bf r'})\,\cdot\,\cdot\,\overline{\overline{\boldsymbol{\chi}}}^{R}({\bf r},{\bf r'})d^{3}{\bf r}d^{3}{\bf r'}\label{eq:dyadicproject}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 where we have defined 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\overline{\boldsymbol{\chi}}}^{R}(\boldsymbol{r},{\bf r'})=-i\,\overline{\overline{\boldsymbol{\chi}}}^{A}(\boldsymbol{r},{\bf r'})$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\overline{\boldsymbol{\chi}}}^{A}$
\end_inset

 the antihermitian part of 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\overline{\boldsymbol{\chi}}}$
\end_inset

 (this makes the power real and discards the non-absorping hermitan part
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\overline{\boldsymbol{\chi}}}$
\end_inset

); and the magnetic field correlation dyadic, an expectation value across
 an ensemble of systems (not required for coherent sources), is:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\overline{\overline{{\bf C}}}({\bf r},{\bf r'})=<{\bf H}({\bf r}){\bf H}^{*}({\bf r'})>\label{eq:calcC}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 The double dot is a full contraction to a scalar.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This clearly has the form of an inner product in the abstract vector space
 of dyadic fields.
 The power absorbed is the projection of the magnetic field correlation
 dyadic onto the susceptibility dyadic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Non-Scattered Case
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If a source at 
\begin_inset Formula ${\bf r}_{n}$
\end_inset

 produces the field 
\begin_inset Formula ${\bf h}_{n}({\bf r})$
\end_inset

, and we have 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 possible source positions, we produce a basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{A}=\{{\bf h}_{n}({\bf r}),\forall n\in1...N\}$
\end_inset

.
 We can then write the matrix elements of 
\family roman
\series medium

\strikeout off
\uuline off
\uwave off
\noun off
\color none

\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\overline{\boldsymbol{\chi}}}^{R}(\boldsymbol{r},{\bf r'})$
\end_inset

 in the basis, and approximately (or exactly, if the source fields span
 the basis of absorption) reconstruct it using the dual vector set:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\chi_{nm}=\varint_{V}\varint_{V}{\bf h}_{n}^{*}({\bf r})\cdot\overline{\overline{\boldsymbol{\chi}}}^{R}({\bf r},{\bf r'})\cdot{\bf h}_{m}({\bf r'})d^{3}{\bf r}d^{3}{\bf r'}
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\overline{\overline{\boldsymbol{\chi}}}^{R}({\bf r},{\bf r'})\approx\sum_{nm}\chi_{nm}{\bf \tilde{h}}_{m}({\bf r}){\bf \tilde{h}}_{m}^{*}({\bf r'})
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since we can find the dual set 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{\tilde{A}}$
\end_inset

 numerically from knowing the forms of the impressed fields, if we know
 the matrix elements 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi_{nm}$
\end_inset

, we can find the response dyadic and diagonalize it to find the natural
 modes of the system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It turns out we can do this using only power measurements: this is the beauty
 of EAI.
 We illuminate the sample with two fully coherent sources so that: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
{\bf H}^{ext}({\bf r}_{j})={\bf h}_{n}+{\bf h}_{m}e^{-i\Delta\phi}
\]

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\phi$
\end_inset

 is a phase that we may rotate.
 We then find that the absorbed power becomes:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
<P(\nu)>=\frac{k_{0}Z_{0}}{2}\left\{ \chi_{nn}+\chi_{mm}+2|\chi_{nm}|\cos\left[\Delta\phi+\arg(\chi_{nm})\right]\right\} 
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi_{nm}$
\end_inset

 is a hermitan matrix, and we may measure the on diagonal terms directly
 from the power absorbance from each source, and the off diagonal terms
 by sweeping the phase between the sources and measuring the resulting fringe
 in the power.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Scattering
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the scattered case the total field is a linear function of the impressed
 field and can be written as:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
{\bf H}({\bf r})=\intop_{V}\overline{\overline{{\bf G}}}({\bf r},{\bf r'})\cdot{\bf H}^{ext}({\bf r'})d^{3}{\bf r'}
\]

\end_inset

 were 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\overline{{\bf G}}}({\bf r},{\bf r'})$
\end_inset

 is the scattering operator which may be calculated from the magnetostatic
 Green's function.
 Since the integral is only over the sample volume, we may regard 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\overline{{\bf G}}}({\bf r},{\bf r'})$
\end_inset

 as intrinsic to the sample and following a similar analysis to above, we
 find that:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
<P(\nu)>=\frac{\omega}{2}\mu_{0}\varint_{V}\varint_{V}\overline{\overline{{\bf C}}}^{ext}({\bf r},{\bf r'})\,\cdot\,\cdot\,\overline{\overline{{\bf K}}}({\bf r},{\bf r'})d^{3}{\bf r}d^{3}{\bf r'}
\]

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\overline{\overline{{\bf K}}}({\bf r},{\bf r'})=\varint_{V}\varint_{V}\overline{\overline{{\bf G}}}^{\dagger}({\bf r},{\bf s})\cdot\overline{\overline{\boldsymbol{\chi}}}^{R}({\bf s},{\bf s'})\cdot\overline{\overline{{\bf G}}}({\bf s'},{\bf r'})d^{3}{\bf s}d^{3}{\bf s'}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus the scattering limits the amount of spatial information we may obtain
 about 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\overline{\boldsymbol{\chi}}}^{R}({\bf s},{\bf s'})$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Matrix Formulation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now that our model is fully discretized, we describe it in terms of matrices.
 The column vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{h^{ext}},\mathrm{h^{tot}}\in\mathbb{C}^{2J}$
\end_inset

 contain the complex amplitudes of the transverse cartesian field components
 of the external and total fields at the position of the dipoles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Clearly from (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:tdef"

\end_inset

) we can write 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{h^{tot}}=\mathrm{T}^{-1}\mathrm{h^{ext}}$
\end_inset

, and also from (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:dyadicproject"

\end_inset

): 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P=\frac{\omega}{2}\mu_{0}(\mathrm{h^{tot}})^{\dagger}\chi^{R}\mathrm{h^{tot}}
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
<P>=\mathrm{Tr}\left[\mathrm{C^{tot}N}\right],\qquad\mathrm{N}=\frac{\omega}{2}\mu_{0}\chi^{R}
\]

\end_inset

 where we have taken then trace of a number and used the cyclic property
 to write 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{C^{tot}}=<\mathrm{h^{tot}}(\mathrm{h^{tot}})^{\dagger}>$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus, we write the power in terms of the external field:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P=\frac{\omega}{2}\mu_{0}(\mathrm{h^{tot}})^{\dagger}\chi^{R}\mathrm{h^{tot}}=\frac{\omega}{2}\mu_{0}(\mathrm{h^{ext}})^{\dagger}(\mathrm{T}^{-1})^{\dagger}\chi^{R}(\mathrm{T}^{-1})\mathrm{h^{ext}}=(\mathrm{h^{ext}})^{\dagger}\mathrm{L}\mathrm{h^{ext}}
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
<P>=\mathrm{Tr}\left[\mathrm{C^{ext}L}\right]\label{eq:calcpower}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{C^{ext}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{L}$
\end_inset

 are hermitian, they may be diagonalized: 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{C^{ext}}=\sum_{i}\alpha_{i}\mathrm{f}_{i}\mathrm{f}_{i}^{\dagger}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{L}=\sum_{i}\beta_{i}\mathrm{g}_{i}\mathrm{g}_{i}^{\dagger}$
\end_inset

.
 The power is then
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
<P>=\sum_{ij}\alpha_{i}\beta_{j}\left|\mathrm{f}_{i}^{\dagger}\mathrm{g}_{j}\right|^{2}
\]

\end_inset

 which describes how the impressed field modes project onto the system modes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Closer examination of L
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We may look more closely at exactly where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{L}$
\end_inset

 comes from and how it may be incrementally built up.
 We have a column vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{m}\in\mathbb{C}^{2J}$
\end_inset

 containing the transverse components of the dipole moments.
 If exchange interactions are present then:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{m}=\chi_{L}\mathrm{h^{ext}}+\chi_{L}\mathrm{G^{xch}m}=(\chi_{L}^{-1}-\mathrm{G^{xch}})^{-1}\equiv\xi\mathrm{h^{ext}}\label{eq:calcxi}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{G^{xch}}$
\end_inset

 is the exchange interaction from (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:exchange"

\end_inset

) and 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi$
\end_inset

 is simply the local susceptibility.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next we include dipole-dipole scattering, with (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:magnetostatic"

\end_inset

) giving us 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{G^{dip}}$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{h^{tot}}=\mathrm{h^{ext}}+\mathrm{G^{dip}m}=(1-\mathrm{G^{dip}}\xi)^{-1}\equiv\kappa\mathrm{h^{ext}}\label{eq:calckappa}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 defining 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa$
\end_inset

, and giving 
\begin_inset Formula $m=\xi\kappa h^{e}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{L}=\frac{\omega}{2}\mu_{0}\kappa^{\dag}\xi^{R}\kappa\label{eq:calcL}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi^{R}$
\end_inset

 is the hermitian part of 
\begin_inset Formula $-i\xi$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, for convenience of computation, we also introduce the matrix:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{M}=\frac{\omega}{2}\mu_{0}\xi^{R}\label{eq:calcm}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Reconstruction with EAI
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{H^{ext}}\in\mathbb{C}^{2J\times2N}$
\end_inset

 is made up of columns containing the fields 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{h^{ext}}$
\end_inset

 associated with particular possible sources.
 If these impressed fields span the absorption modes, the response matrix
 can be written in terms of the duals:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{L}=\sum_{nm}a_{nm}\mathrm{\tilde{h}_{n}^{ext}}\mathrm{\tilde{h}_{m}^{ext\dagger}}=\mathrm{\tilde{H}A\tilde{H}^{\dagger}}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 so 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{A}$
\end_inset

 gives the response in the basis of the sources.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The power absorbed due to two sources is given by:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P=[\mathrm{h_{1}^{ext\dagger}}e^{-i\phi_{1}}+\mathrm{h_{2}^{ext}}e^{-i\phi_{2}}]\,\mathrm{L}\,\mathrm{[h_{1}^{ext}}e^{i\phi_{1}}+\mathrm{h_{2}^{ext\dagger}}e^{i\phi_{2}}]
\]

\end_inset

 and subbing in the response:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
P_{nm}=a_{nn}+a_{mm}+a_{nm}e^{i\Delta\phi}+a_{mn}e^{-i\Delta\phi}\label{eq:powertoa}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 so we may measure a fringe in the power by rotating the phase, and hence
 find the matrix elements of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{A}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Deconvolution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{A}$
\end_inset

 contains the intrinsic absorbances of the dipoles, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{N}$
\end_inset

, convolved with the scattering and exchange interactions, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{T}^{-1}$
\end_inset

, and finally the greens function taking the field at the sources to the
 dipoles.
 Generally only the final step may be deconvolved, as if we know the source
 properties we may calculate the forms of the impressed fields and invert
 them (we are allowed to do this because if we do not have fundamental dipole
 locations then we use DDA which gives them to us).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The dual vectors are defined by 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{H^{ext\dagger}\tilde{H}^{ext}}=1$
\end_inset

, but inversion is not possible if J is not equal to N.
 We use the SVD pseudo-inverse, defined by:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathrm{H}=\mathrm{U\Sigma V^{\dagger}}\implies\mathrm{\tilde{H}}=\mathrm{U\Sigma^{-1}V^{\dagger}};\qquad\mathrm{H^{\dagger}\tilde{H}=U\Sigma\Sigma^{-1}U^{\dagger}}
\]

\end_inset

 which correctly accounts for numbers of source positions and sample points.
 If the basis is complete, or overcomplete, the final relation will equal
 the identity.
 If it is undercomplete, the modes are projected onto a measurement space,
 a filter is applied (which may be impossible to get rid of due to noise)
 and then the modes are reconstructed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The whole process may be done using incremental SVD, where each new measurement
 increases information until all degrees of freedom are found.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Coherence
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The complex visibility is defined by:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\gamma_{nm}=\frac{2a_{nm}}{a_{nn}+a_{mm}}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We may plot 
\begin_inset Formula $|\gamma_{nm}|$
\end_inset

 and the argument as a function of position by keeping 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 fixed whilst varying 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

.
 The modulus reveals the coherence lengths, areas and volumes through which
 the sample may absorb energy, and the argument is used to reconstruct the
 modes using EAI.

\begin_layout Section
Modeling Methodology

\begin_layout Subsection
Responses
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Henceforth, all calculations were done in the basis with the fields or moments
 at the dipole locations with 
\begin_inset Formula ${\bf H}^{ext(0)}=1$
\end_inset

 unless otherwise stated, and we also set our units such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{0}=1$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A given dipole system is described by an array of dipoles, each specified
 in terms of 
\begin_inset Formula ${\bf r}_{j},\alpha_{j},\gamma_{j},m_{j}^{s}$
\end_inset

 (generalized functions to create linear and circular such systems were
 made).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For a given system the response matrix was calculated as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Calculate the local susceptibility (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Calculate the dipole scattering matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{G^{dip}}$

\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:calckappa"

\end_inset

), (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:calcL"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that the matrices depend on the frequency of excitation, and the applied
 static field.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now the absorbed power for a given set of sources was found:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Calculate the external field at each dipole from the sources using the Greens
 Function as a matrix (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Calculate the magnetic correlation matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{C^{ext}}$
\end_inset

 (

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Calculate the absorbed power (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The absorbed powers from some simple systems were then checked against (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Reconstruction with EAI
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, to reconstruct the responses, we:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Assemble a set of sources that will be used for the testing.
 They may be laid out in a line or a circle or some other shape.
 For this set assemble the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{H^{ext}}$
\end_inset

 using the magnetostatic Green's function (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:magnetostatic"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
For each pair of sources measure the complex visibility as the relative
 phase is varied.
 This may be done directly with measurements at 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\phi=0,\pi/2$
\end_inset

 or by sweeping the phase and fitting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Using the above and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:powertoa"

\end_inset

, assemble the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{A}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Use SVD to calculate the dual matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\widetilde{\mathrm{H}}^{\mathrm{ext}}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Calculate the reconstructed response matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{L'}=\mathrm{\tilde{H}^{ext}A\tilde{H}^{ext\dagger}}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can compare the reconstructed matrix with the one used to calculate the
 response in order to quantify how well we have reconstructed the modes.
