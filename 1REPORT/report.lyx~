\begin_layout Title
Exploring the Dynamical Behavior of Spin Waves Through Energy-Absorption
 Interferometry
\end_layout

\begin_layout Author
Felix Biggs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Energy absorption interferometry can be used to find the natural dynamical
 modes of a system of interacting magnetic dipoles, using only measurements
 of total absorbed power.
 This is of enormous utility in the investigation of magnetic properties
 of nanoscale and thin-film systems, areas of great technological significance
 and contemporary research interest, due to their use in magnetic storage
 media and spintronic devices.
 Previously used to investigate interacting electric dipoles, it is a general
 technique based on the physics of partially coherent energy absorption

, and has been theoretically shown applicable to systems of interacting
 magnetic dipoles.
 Here simulations based on the discrete dipole approximation (DDA) are shown,
 illustrating this in practice, comparing it to other techniques such as
 Ferromagnetic Resonance (FMR), and to demonstrate some of the properties
 of such systems.
 Experimental realization requires only a static applied field, scannable
 phase locked sources, and an ability to measure absorbed power; these are
 simple requirements which make the method highly practicable at a range
 of frequencies.
 The modes may be found for a range of applied fields and mapped spatially,
 using our knowledge of the forms of the source impressed fields, revealling
 yet more about the system.

As an example of how quickly developments in this area influence the technology
 sector, the giant magnetoresistive effect (GMR) was discovered in 1988
 (leading to the award of the 2007 Nobel Prize in Physics) and was demonstrated
 in a hard disk drive read head by 1994, being commercialized shortly thereafter.
 Between the introduction of the first hard disk drive in 1956 to 2007,
 there was a 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{10^{8}}$
\end_inset

 increase in magnetic recording density.
 This progress depends on decreasing the magnetic grain sizes, but demanding
 problems must be solved as nanoscale sized structures are reached - inevitably
 leading to a desire for greater understanding of the fundamental physics
 involved

Spin Waves
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fundamentally, magnetism arises from the Pauli exclusion principle coupling
 electron orbitals to spin states.
 This exchange interaction can be phenomenologically written by treating
 atoms as directly coupled dipoles, or as a mean field in the rigid band
 model of metals

 Spin waves are coherent excitations of these magnetic dipoles, with scale
 lengths from

 Their spectrum is highly dependent on the intrinsic system properties and
 can yield useful information about g-factors, saturation magnetization

 They were originally studied in bulk materials but recently focus has shifted
 towards engineering microscopic band gaps to perform operations such as
 data manipulation and storage as described above.
 There is also much current research in spintronics, a field combining electrica
l and magnetic manipulation of spins system in solid-state devices, and
 driven by range of potential applications, such as a circularly polarised
 spin laser

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At low frequencies they are mediated by dipole-dipole interactions and at
 high frequencies exchange interactions.
 They can be created by applying a large static field and a small time varying
 field to a magnetic material - the static field causes the dipoles to align,
 or at least form domains, and the time-varying field causes excitations.
 They may also be excited thermally by phonons (central to understanding
 the destruction of magnetic order, of key importance in magnetic storage
 media), or by visible or radio frequency photons, allowing for experimental
 investigation

 For a more visual picture we may use a semi-classical model in which the
 dipoles precess on the surfaces of cones about the direction of the applied
 field.
 The low-lying elementary excitations have successive spins advanced in
 phase by a constant angle, giving the form of a disturbance that propagates
 as a wave

A recent advance is the development of processes to create magnetic nanoparticle
s with control of sizes and shapes, with great potential technological applicati
on.
 The determination of their normal modes and ability to control them has
 important technological implications; an example is that read head size
 is fundamentally limited by spin-wave noise, which could be reduced by
 suitable design choices

Typically we are interested in scale sizes and forms of dynamical modes

\begin_layout Standard
Measurement of very small samples can be challenging due to the amount of
 material.
 A number of techniques are commonly used to investigate general magnetic
 properties, including: SQUID magnetometers, x-ray magnetic circular dichroism
 (XMCD), using the magnetoopic Kerr effect (MOKE) and other specialist technique
s.
 More direct investigation of the spin wave dynamics may be achieved through
 the Brillon light scattering and ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) techniques

\begin_layout Standard
Ferromagnetic resonance, one of the most useful contemporary techniques,
 is at microwave frequencies similar in principle to nuclear spin resonance
 (NMR).
 In a strong applied magnetic field spins precess and the transmission of
 radio frequency (RF) or x-ray energy is attenuated, dependent on the relation
 between precession and applied frequencies.
 The field strength is varied and attenuation is measured 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 In a ferromagnetic sample, the transverse susceptibility is large and the
 strong exchange coupling tends to suppress dipolar contributions so resonance
 lines may be quite sharp

 It gives useful information about dispersion and damping but is difficult
 to apply to microscopic structures and provides little information about
 the modes responsible for absorption, for example their spatial forms or

Energy Absorption Interferometry
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Energy Absorption Interferometry (EAI) was first proposed in the context
 of electric dipoles and is a general technique for studying modes based
 on the physics of coherent energy absorption 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "stafford-elec"

\end_inset

.
 It is a generalisation of holography in magnetic systems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The general setup is similar to FMR, with the structure under test placed
 in a large static magnetic field.
 It differs in that rather than one source, instead a pair of phase-locked
 time-varying sources - say magnetic dipoles - are used to probe the system,
 and the total power absorbed by the is measured.
 This is dependent on the phase difference between the sources, giving a
 fringe in power absorption.
 The complex visibility of this fringe is measured for pairs of source locations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From this, the technique is able to reconstruct the dynamical modes and
 their relative responsivities.
 This can be done for any given source frequency and applied field, and
 may further be repeated for a range of applied field strengths.
 Degenerate excitations may be seperated, giving information about system
 symmetries, and the spatial forms of the modes may be mapped using knowledge
 of the impressed field forms.
 We may thus yield a huge amount of useful information about the system.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Experimental Realization
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The simplicity of the technique, requiring only phase-locked sources and
 a measurement of the total absorbed power absorbtion, makes it realizable
 in a variety of experimetal setups.
 It is even applicable to different situations entirely, such as the already
 demonstrated electric dipoles.
 Here we will describe one possible implementation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A thin sample is supported by a thermally isolated Si membrane, and bolometer
 technology is used to very sensitively measure the absorbed power.
 This is placed in a large static magnetic field from a DC solenoid and
 illuminated by a pair of phase-locked magnetic sources which are rotated
 around the periphery, exciting spin waves.
 In practice these sources might simply be slightly offset in frequency
 and the oscillation of power absorption measured to find the phase (already
 demonstrated in the electronic case

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the purposes of its reconstruction, the system is treated as a discrete
 set of magnetic dipoles, which may be fundamental excitations or elements
 of the discrete dipole approximation (DDA), a versatile technique often
 used to model scattering.

\begin_layout Standard
The system is modelled as a discrete system of magnetic dipoles.
 This may be done for any system using the discrete dipole approximation
 (DDA) - the equation then represents averages over finite macroscopic regions.
 A single dipole with magnetic dipole moment 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{{\bf m_{j}}}$
\end_inset

 will evolve according the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{d{\bf {m_{j}}}}{dt}=-\gamma_{j}\mu_{0}{\bf {m_{j}}}\times{\bf {H}}_{j}^{tot}+\frac{\alpha_{j}}{|{\bf {m_{j}}}|}({\bf {m_{j}}}\times\frac{{d{\bf {m_{j}}}}}{dt})\label{eq:llg}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 is an index which specifies a dipole, 
\begin_inset Formula ${\bf H}_{j}^{tot}$
\end_inset

 is the total magnetic field at the dipole, 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{j}$
\end_inset

 is the gyromagnetic ratio of the dipole (positive and negative values correspon
ding to opposite rotation directions) and 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{j}$
\end_inset

 is a phenomenological damping coefficient (in FMR, for the transverse component
s of the dynamic part of the magnetization).
 This equation could be generalized to a Bloch equation with different longitudi
nal and transverse dampings, but this will not be done, simplifying the
 analysis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We move to the steady state by writing 
\begin_inset Formula ${\bf H}_{j}^{tot}={\bf H}_{j}^{tot\,(0)}+{\bf H}_{j}^{tot\,(t)}$
\end_inset

, representing the non-time dependent and time dependent terms, provided
 by the large static field and the smaller RF sources respectively.
 Thus when only the static field is present, the system equilibrates into
 a state 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{{\bf m_{j}}}^{(0)}$
\end_inset

 with no torque on the dipoles (from 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:llg"

\end_inset

).
 Generally, the dipoles can form non-aligned domains, but we assume they
 are in the saturated state: all totally aligned with the static field,
 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{{\bf m_{j}}}^{(0)}=m^{s}\hat{{\bf k}}$
\end_inset

 (the saturated magnetization), and 
\begin_inset Formula ${\bf H}^{tot(0)}\equiv H^{0}\hat{{\bf k}}\approx{\bf H}^{ext(0)}$
\end_inset

.
 We also make the vital assumption that in the steady state, all of the
 absorbed (or indeed extracted) power is transferred to the substrate (physicall
y, its phonon system).

 Substituting into LLG and discarding non-linear terms (effectively the
 approximation 
\begin_inset Formula ${\bf m_{j}}\cdot{\bf \hat{k}}\approx{\bf m_{j}}^{(0)}$
\end_inset

, that the static component is much greater than the parallel dynamical
 component) we get:

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Non-Interacting Case
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Inverting the above equation we can write the susceptibility of a system
 of non-interacting, precessing dipoles with position vectors 
\begin_inset Formula ${\bf r}_{0j}$
\end_inset

 as:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\overline{\overline{\boldsymbol{\chi}}}_{L}({\bf r})=\sum_{j}\frac{\gamma_{j}\mu_{0}m_{j}^{s}\omega}{(\omega_{0j}^{2}-\omega^{2})-i\omega\Gamma_{j}}\overline{\overline{\textrm{\ensuremath{\boldsymbol{S}}}}}_{j}\delta(\boldsymbol{r-\boldsymbol{r_{0j}}})\label{eq:localx}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\overline{\overline{\boldsymbol{{\bf S}}}}_{j}=\frac{\omega_{0j}}{\omega}\boldsymbol{\hat{i}\hat{i}}+i\boldsymbol{\hat{j}\hat{i}}-i\boldsymbol{\hat{i}\hat{j}}+\frac{\omega_{0j}}{\omega}\boldsymbol{\hat{j}\hat{j}},\quad S_{j}=\left(\begin{array}{cc}
\omega_{0}/\omega & -i\\
i & \omega_{0}/\omega
\end{array}\right)
\]

\end_inset

 using dyadics.
 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{j}$
\end_inset

 is the matrix form of 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\overline{\boldsymbol{{\bf S}}}}_{j}$
\end_inset

 (see appendix for detail).
 The 
\begin_inset Formula ${\bf m}_{j}^{(1)}$
\end_inset

 are time independent in the plane perpendicular to 
\begin_inset Formula ${\bf H}^{(0)}$
\end_inset

.
 The natural frequency of precession is 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{0j}=\gamma_{j}\mu_{0}H_{j}^{(0)}$
\end_inset

, and the damping rate is 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma_{j}=2\alpha_{j}\omega_{0j}$
\end_inset

.
 We have assumed low loss (small 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{j}$
\end_inset

).
 Now the spatial dipole moment is 
\begin_inset Formula ${\bf M}^{(1)}({\bf r})=\overline{\overline{\chi}}_{L}({\bf r})\cdot{\bf H}^{ext(1)}({\bf r})$
\end_inset

, with no spatial integral or 
\begin_inset Formula ${\bf r'}$
\end_inset

 dependence, as the non-interacting case is totally local.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The natural modes of the isolated dipole are found from the eigenvectors
 and eigenvalues (diagonalisation) of 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\overline{{\bf S}}}$
\end_inset

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
{\bf u}_{+}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\hat{{\bf i}}+i\hat{{\bf j}}),\quad\lambda_{+}=\frac{\omega_{0}}{\omega}+1
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
{\bf u}_{-}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\hat{{\bf i}}-i\hat{{\bf j}}),\quad\lambda_{-}=\frac{\omega_{0}}{\omega}-1
\]

\end_inset

 corresponding respectively to rotation in the the natural precession direction,
 and in the reverse direction,.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Interacting Case
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can write 
\begin_inset Formula ${\bf H}_{j}^{tot}={\bf H}_{j}^{ext}+{\bf H}_{j}^{xch}+{\bf H}_{j}^{dip}$
\end_inset

, where the terms respectively represent the applied external field on the
 system, the effective field from exchange interactions between dipoles,
 and the scattered field from the other dipoles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The exchange interaction effective field at a dipole can be written as:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
{\bf H}_{j}^{xch}=J\sum_{k=NN}{\bf m}_{k}\label{eq:exchange}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 where NN indicates the nearest neighbors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The dipole scattering term is:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
{\bf H}^{dip(1)}({\bf r)}=\int\overline{\overline{{\bf G}}}({\bf r},{\bf r'})\cdot{\bf M}^{(1)}({\bf r'})d{\bf r'}
\]

\end_inset

 using the non-retarded magnetostatic greens dyadic (retardation could also
 be easily included, but we will not do so here):
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\overline{\overline{{\bf G}}}({\bf r},{\bf r'})=\frac{1}{R^{3}}\left(3\frac{{\bf RR}}{R^{2}}-\overline{\overline{{\bf I}}}\right),\quad{\bf R}={\bf r}-{\bf r'},\quad R=|{\bf R}|\label{eq:magnetostatic}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We may now combine these terms and the non interacting susceptibility to
 give:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
{\bf H}^{ext(1)}({\bf r}_{i})=\sum_{j}\overline{\overline{{\bf T}}}_{ji}\cdot{\bf H}^{tot(1)}({\bf r}_{j})\label{eq:tdef}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\overline{\overline{{\bf T}}}_{ij}=\overline{\overline{{\bf I}}}\delta_{ij}-\frac{\gamma_{i}\mu_{0}m_{i}^{s}\omega}{(\omega_{0i}^{2}-\omega^{2})-i\omega\Gamma_{i}}\left\{ J\delta_{i,NN}\overline{\overline{{\bf S}}}_{i}+(1-\delta_{ij})\overline{\overline{{\bf G}}}({\bf r}_{j},{\bf r}_{i})\cdot\overline{\overline{{\bf S}}}_{i}\right\} 
\]

\end_inset

which can be written as a matrix equation in the dipole locations, and inverted
 to give the total field at each dipole in terms of the applied field.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Power Absorption
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since EAI uses power absorption measurements, calculation of them is needed.
 In the explicitly time dependent and real case, the instantaneous power
 absorption is:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P(t)=\mu_{0}\int{\bf H}({\bf r},t)\cdot\frac{\partial{\bf M}({\bf r},t)}{\partial t}d^{3}{\bf r}
\]

\end_inset

 Using the definition of non-local susceptibility,
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
{\bf M}({\bf r})=\int\overline{\overline{\boldsymbol{\chi}}}({\bf r},{\bf r'})\cdot{\bf H}({\bf r'})d^{3}{\bf r'}
\]

\end_inset

the time average power absorption is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{multline}
P(\nu)=\frac{\omega}{2}\mu_{0}\mathrm{Im}\varint_{V}{\bf H}^{*}({\bf r})\cdot{\bf M}({\bf r})d^{3}{\bf r}=\frac{\omega}{2}\mu_{0}\mathrm{Im}\varint_{V}\varint_{V}{\bf H}^{*}({\bf r})\cdot\overline{\overline{\boldsymbol{\chi}}}({\bf r},{\bf r'})\cdot{\bf H}({\bf r'})d^{3}{\bf r}d^{3}{\bf r'}
\end{multline}

\end_inset

 over the volume of the sample, 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

, since the susceptibility elsewhere is zero.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For our system of dipoles we thus find a power absorption:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
P(\nu)=\sum_{j}\frac{\gamma_{j}\mu_{0}^{2}m_{j}^{s}}{2}\left[\frac{\omega\Gamma_{j}}{\omega^{2}(\frac{\omega_{0j}^{2}}{\omega^{2}}-1)^{2}+\Gamma_{j}^{2}}\right]\times{\bf H}_{j}^{tot(1)*}\cdot\overline{\overline{{\bf S}_{j}}}\cdot{\bf H}_{j}^{tot(1)}\label{eq:checkpower}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 If the system is rotationally excited, 
\begin_inset Formula ${\bf H}^{tot(1)}({\bf r}_{i})=a{\bf u}_{\pm}$
\end_inset

, the absorbed power will be
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
<P(a{\bf u}_{\pm})>=\frac{1}{2}a^{2}\Gamma\gamma\mu_{0}^{2}m_{s}\frac{\omega(\omega_{0}/\omega\pm1)}{\omega^{2}(\omega_{0}^{2}/\omega^{2}-1)^{2}+\Gamma^{2}}
\]

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We see from the numerator that the power is always positive for rotation
 with the natural precession direction, and reaches a peak at 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega=\omega_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 For the opposite direction rotations, the power is zero at 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega=\omega_{0}$
\end_inset

, and work may be done by the system for 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega>\omega_{0}$
\end_inset

, taking energy out of the dipole.
 Physically the natural precession rotation direction rotation would dominate
 since the negative power modes would be quickly damped by the applied field.
 In fact, even in a multi-dipole interacting case, modes fall into two separable
 subsets with opposite rotation directions - there are no mixed modes.
 In practice, this rapid relaxation of the opposite rotation modes makes
 them more difficult to resolve with EAI.
 However, we are not generally interested in them, so we will focus on the
 positive absorption, natural precession direction modes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
EAI
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After a number of steps from the above forms for the power we may arrive
 at the most useful form: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
<P(\nu)>=\frac{\omega}{2}\mu_{0}\varint_{V}\varint_{V}\overline{\overline{{\bf C}}}^{tot}({\bf r},{\bf r'})\,\cdot\,\cdot\,\overline{\overline{\boldsymbol{\chi}}}^{R}({\bf r},{\bf r'})d^{3}{\bf r}d^{3}{\bf r'}\label{eq:dyadicproject}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 where we have defined 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\overline{\boldsymbol{\chi}}}^{R}(\boldsymbol{r},{\bf r'})=-i\,\overline{\overline{\boldsymbol{\chi}}}^{A}(\boldsymbol{r},{\bf r'})$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\overline{\boldsymbol{\chi}}}^{A}$
\end_inset

 the antihermitian part of 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\overline{\boldsymbol{\chi}}}$
\end_inset

 (only the antihermitian part of 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\overline{\boldsymbol{\chi}}}$
\end_inset

 is responsible for power absorption; the hermitian part is reactive and
 causes power scattering).
 The magnetic field correlation dyadic, an expectation value across an ensemble
 of systems (not required for coherent sources), is:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\overline{\overline{{\bf C}}}({\bf r},{\bf r'})=<{\bf H}({\bf r}){\bf H}^{*}({\bf r'})>\label{eq:calcC}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 The double dot is a full contraction to a scalar.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 has the form of an inner product in the abstract vector space of dyadic
 fields.
 The power absorbed is the projection of the magnetic field correlation
 dyadic onto the susceptibility dyadic; in other words it describes the
 orthogonal projection of state of coherence of the applied field onto the
 state to which the dipoles are most sensitive.

\chi_{nm}=\varint_{V}\varint_{V}{\bf h}_{n}^{*}({\bf r})\cdot\overline{\overline{\boldsymbol{\chi}}}^{R}({\bf r},{\bf r'})\cdot{\bf h}_{m}({\bf r'})d^{3}{\bf r}d^{3}{\bf r'}
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\overline{\overline{\boldsymbol{\chi}}}^{R}({\bf r},{\bf r'})\approx\sum_{nm}\chi_{nm}{\bf \tilde{h}}_{m}({\bf r}){\bf \tilde{h}}_{m}^{*}({\bf r'})
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since we can find the dual set 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{\tilde{A}}$
\end_inset

 numerically from knowing the forms of the impressed fields, if we know
 the matrix elements 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi_{nm}$
\end_inset

, we can find the response dyadic and diagonalize it to find the natural
 modes of the system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It turns out we can do this using only power measurements: this is the beauty
 of EAI.
 We illuminate the sample with two fully coherent sources so that: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
{\bf H}^{ext}({\bf r}_{j})={\bf h}_{n}+{\bf h}_{m}e^{-i\Delta\phi}
\]

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\phi$
\end_inset

 is a phase that we may rotate.
 We then find that the absorbed power becomes:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
<P(\nu)>=\frac{k_{0}Z_{0}}{2}\left\{ \chi_{nn}+\chi_{mm}+2|\chi_{nm}|\cos\left[\Delta\phi+\arg(\chi_{nm})\right]\right\} 
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi_{nm}$
\end_inset

 is a hermitan matrix, and we may measure the on diagonal terms directly
 from the power absorbance from each source, and the off diagonal terms
 by sweeping the phase between the sources and measuring the resulting fringe
 in the power.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Scattering by Dipoles
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When we include dipole scattering, the total field at each dipole is a linear
 function of the unscattered, impressed field.
 It can be written as:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
{\bf H}({\bf r})=\intop_{V}\overline{\overline{{\bf G}}}({\bf r},{\bf r'})\cdot{\bf H}^{ext}({\bf r'})d^{3}{\bf r'}
\]

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\overline{{\bf G}}}({\bf r},{\bf r'})$
\end_inset

 is the scattering operator, calculated from the magnetostatic Green's function.
 Since the integral is only over the sample volume, we may regard 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\overline{{\bf G}}}({\bf r},{\bf r'})$
\end_inset

 as intrinsic to the sample and following a similar analysis to above, we
 find that:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
<P(\nu)>=\frac{\omega}{2}\mu_{0}\varint_{V}\varint_{V}\overline{\overline{{\bf C}}}^{ext}({\bf r},{\bf r'})\,\cdot\,\cdot\,\overline{\overline{{\bf K}}}({\bf r},{\bf r'})d^{3}{\bf r}d^{3}{\bf r'}
\]

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\overline{\overline{{\bf K}}}({\bf r},{\bf r'})=\varint_{V}\varint_{V}\overline{\overline{{\bf G}}}^{\dagger}({\bf r},{\bf s})\cdot\overline{\overline{\boldsymbol{\chi}}}^{R}({\bf s},{\bf s'})\cdot\overline{\overline{{\bf G}}}({\bf s'},{\bf r'})d^{3}{\bf s}d^{3}{\bf s'}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus the scattering limits the amount of spatial information we may obtain
 about 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\overline{\boldsymbol{\chi}}}^{R}({\bf s},{\bf s'})$
\end_inset

, since it reduces our ability to map the total field directly onto the
 dipole locations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Matrix Formulation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now that our model is fully discretized, we describe it in terms of matrices.
 The column vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{h^{ext}},\mathrm{h^{tot}}\in\mathbb{C}^{2J}$
\end_inset

 contain the complex amplitudes of the transverse cartesian field components
 of the external and total fields at the position of the dipoles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Clearly from (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:tdef"

\end_inset

) we can write 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{h^{tot}}=\mathrm{T}^{-1}\mathrm{h^{ext}}$
\end_inset

, and also from (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:dyadicproject"

\end_inset

): 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P=\frac{\omega}{2}\mu_{0}(\mathrm{h^{tot}})^{\dagger}\chi^{R}\mathrm{h^{tot}}
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
<P>=\mathrm{Tr}\left[\mathrm{C^{tot}N}\right],\qquad\mathrm{N}=\frac{\omega}{2}\mu_{0}\chi^{R}
\]

\end_inset

 where we have taken then trace of a number and used the cyclic property
 to write 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{C^{tot}}=<\mathrm{h^{tot}}(\mathrm{h^{tot}})^{\dagger}>$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus, we write the power in terms of the external field:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P=\frac{\omega}{2}\mu_{0}(\mathrm{h^{tot}})^{\dagger}\chi^{R}\mathrm{h^{tot}}=\frac{\omega}{2}\mu_{0}(\mathrm{h^{ext}})^{\dagger}(\mathrm{T}^{-1})^{\dagger}\chi^{R}(\mathrm{T}^{-1})\mathrm{h^{ext}}=(\mathrm{h^{ext}})^{\dagger}\mathrm{L}\mathrm{h^{ext}}
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
<P>=\mathrm{Tr}\left[\mathrm{C^{ext}L}\right]\label{eq:calcpower}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{C^{ext}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{L}$
\end_inset

 are hermitian, they may be diagonalized: 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{C^{ext}}=\sum_{i}\alpha_{i}\mathrm{f}_{i}\mathrm{f}_{i}^{\dagger}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{L}=\sum_{i}\beta_{i}\mathrm{g}_{i}\mathrm{g}_{i}^{\dagger}$
\end_inset

.
 The power is then
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
<P>=\sum_{ij}\alpha_{i}\beta_{j}\left|\mathrm{f}_{i}^{\dagger}\mathrm{g}_{j}\right|^{2}
\]

\end_inset

 which describes how the impressed field modes project onto the system modes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Closer examination of L
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We may look more closely at exactly where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{L}$
\end_inset

 comes from and how it may be incrementally built up.
 We have a column vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{m}\in\mathbb{C}^{2J}$
\end_inset

, containing the transverse components of the dipole moments.
 If exchange interactions are present then:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{m}=\chi_{L}\mathrm{h^{ext}}+\chi_{L}\mathrm{G^{xch}m}=(\chi_{L}^{-1}-\mathrm{G^{xch}})^{-1}\equiv\xi\mathrm{h^{ext}}\label{eq:calcxi}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{G^{xch}}$
\end_inset

 is the exchange interaction from (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:exchange"

\end_inset

) and 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi_{L}$
\end_inset

 is simply the local susceptibility.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next we include dipole-dipole scattering, with (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:magnetostatic"

\end_inset

) giving us 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{G^{dip}}$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{h^{tot}}=\mathrm{h^{ext}}+\mathrm{G^{dip}m}=(1-\mathrm{G^{dip}}\xi)^{-1}\equiv\kappa\mathrm{h^{ext}}\label{eq:calckappa}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 defining 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa$
\end_inset

, and giving 
\begin_inset Formula $m=\xi\kappa h^{e}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{L}=\frac{\omega}{2}\mu_{0}\kappa^{\dag}\xi^{R}\kappa\label{eq:calcL}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi^{R}$
\end_inset

 is the hermitian part of 
\begin_inset Formula $-i\xi$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Reconstruction with EAI
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{H^{ext}}\in\mathbb{C}^{2J\times2N}$
\end_inset

 is made up of columns containing the fields 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{h^{ext}}$
\end_inset

 associated with particular possible sources.
 These sources may be near-field point sources, in which case the Green's
 function is that of 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:magnetostatic"

\end_inset

, or we might include retardation and move them further away to get plane
 wave sources (resulting in a loss of some spatial information but generally
 making it easier to span the modes).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If these impressed fields span the absorption modes, the response matrix
 can be written in terms of the duals:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{L}=\sum_{nm}a_{nm}\mathrm{\tilde{h}_{n}^{ext}}\mathrm{\tilde{h}_{m}^{ext\dagger}}=\mathrm{\tilde{H}A\tilde{H}^{\dagger}}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 so 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{A}$
\end_inset

 gives the response in the basis of the sources.
 Its dimension must be greater than or equal to that of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{L}$
\end_inset

 if the response is to be completely described.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The power absorbed due to two sources is given by:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P=[\mathrm{h_{1}^{ext\dagger}}e^{-i\phi_{1}}+\mathrm{h_{2}^{ext}}e^{-i\phi_{2}}]\,\mathrm{L}\,\mathrm{[h_{1}^{ext}}e^{i\phi_{1}}+\mathrm{h_{2}^{ext\dagger}}e^{i\phi_{2}}]
\]

\end_inset

 and subbing in the response:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
P_{nm}=a_{nn}+a_{mm}+a_{nm}e^{i\Delta\phi}+a_{mn}e^{-i\Delta\phi}\label{eq:powertoa}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 so we may measure a fringe in the power by rotating the phase, and hence
 find the matrix elements of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{A}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Spatial Mapping
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{A}$
\end_inset

 contains the intrinsic absorbances of the dipoles, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{N}$
\end_inset

, convolved with the scattering and exchange interactions, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{T}^{-1}$
\end_inset

, and finally the greens function taking the field at the sources to the
 dipoles.
 This is already highly useful.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We may however deconvolve the final step to find information about the spatial
 distributions of the dipoles, as if we know the source properties we may
 calculate the forms of the impressed fields and invert them (we are allowed
 to do this because if we do not have fundamental dipole locations then
 we use DDA which gives them to us).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The dual vectors are defined by 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{H^{ext\dagger}\tilde{H}^{ext}}=1$
\end_inset

, but inversion is not possible if J is not equal to N.
 We thus use the SVD pseudo-inverse, defined by:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathrm{H}=\mathrm{U\Sigma V^{\dagger}}\implies\mathrm{\tilde{H}}=\mathrm{U\Sigma^{-1}V^{\dagger}};\qquad\mathrm{H^{\dagger}\tilde{H}=U\Sigma\Sigma^{-1}U^{\dagger}}
\]

\end_inset

 which correctly accounts for numbers of source positions and sample points.
 If the basis is complete, or over-complete, the final relation will equal
 the identity.
 If it is under-complete, the modes are projected onto a measurement space,
 a filter is applied (which may be impossible to get rid of due to noise)
 and then the modes are reconstructed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The whole process may be done using incremental SVD, where each new measurement
 increases information until all degrees of freedom are found.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Coherence
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The complex visibility is defined by:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\gamma_{nm}=\frac{2a_{nm}}{a_{nn}+a_{mm}}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We may plot 
\begin_inset Formula $|\gamma_{nm}|$
\end_inset

 and the argument as a function of position by keeping 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 fixed whilst varying 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

.
 The modulus reveals the coherence lengths, areas and volumes through which
 the sample may absorb energy, and the argument is used to reconstruct the
 modes using EAI.

\begin_layout Standard
Henceforth, all calculations were done in the basis with the fields or moments

\begin_inset Formula ${\bf H}^{ext(0)}=1$
\end_inset

 unless otherwise stated, and our units are set such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{0}=1$

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A given dipole system is described by an array of dipoles, each specified
 in terms of 
\begin_inset Formula ${\bf r}_{j},\alpha_{j},\gamma_{j},m_{j}^{s}$

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that the matrices depend on the frequency of excitation, and the applied

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Reconstruction with EAI
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, to reconstruct the responses, we:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Assemble a set of sources that will be used for the testing.
 They may be point sources laid out in a line or a circle, or plane wave
 sources.
 For this set assemble the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{H^{ext}}$
\end_inset

 using the magnetostatic Green's function (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
For each pair of sources measure the complex visibility as the relative
 phase is varied.
 This may be done directly with measurements at 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\phi=0,\pi/2$
\end_inset

 or by sweeping the phase and fitting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Using the above and

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The reconstructed matrix can be compared with the one used to calculate
 the response in order to quantify how well the modes have been reconstructed.

Frequency Response
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Firstly we consider the system with two dipoles on the x axis, spaced 
\begin_inset Formula $0.8$
\end_inset

 apart with and each with a natural frequency of precession 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{0}=1$
\end_inset

, magnetization 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{0}m_{s}=1$
\end_inset

, and damping 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma=1/16$
\end_inset

 at an applied field strength of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{0}H^{(0)}=1$
\end_inset

.
 They were driven in the steady state by a single, circularly polarized
 source at 
\begin_inset Formula $x=y=2$
\end_inset

 so as to excite in-phase and anti-phase modes.
 We show the resonant coupling as a function of frequency for three different
 exchange couplings, 
\begin_inset Formula $J=0.001,\,0.1,\,0.4$
\end_inset

\end_layout

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We see that in the case of very weak coupling (
\begin_inset Formula $J=0.001$
\end_inset

) the dipoles behave as degenerate independent dipoles with a single lorenzian
 response, peak at 1 and width 1/16.
 When the exchange couplings are increased we see the system split into
 two modes, in phase (lower frequency peak) and anti-phase (transverse component
s of dipoles in opposite directions at any given time, still rotating in
 natural precession direction at applied frequency, higher frequency mode).
 The peaks of the modes are moved by the value of the coupling constant
 away from the natural frequency 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{0}$
\end_inset

, but they still have the same widths.
 Note at this source location the in phase mode is more absorbent at its
 resonant frequency.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another interesting effect (not shown) is found when the coupling coefficient
 is very large 
\begin_inset Formula $J\rightarrow1$
\end_inset

.
 The maximum power absorbances drops to low values as the dipoles effectively
 screen each other - for the anti-phase mode the dipoles almost cancel each
 other out, and for the in phase, the peak frequency is very low and hence
 has low absorbance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now we consider the above system with

 magnetic field (using the fundamental dipole properties 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma=1,\alpha=1/32$

 This done with the same source but at two different frequencies shown,

Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A general system was created to simulate the responses of various possible
 systems of magnetic dipoles, including dipoles arranged in a circle and
 in a line, and sources to excite them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using this it was shown that only a pair of scannable phase locked sources
 are needed to reconstruct these responses.
 Using knowledge of the free space forms of the applied magnetic field these
 responses were mapped back onto the spatial distribution of dipoles, yeilding
 useful information about the system.
 This is potentially of great experimental value.
 To show this, it was demonstrated that it is comparitively difficult to
 extract such information using more widely used methods, such as ferromagnetic
 resonance or scanning a single souce across a line.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The properties of such systems were then explored, also serving as a useful
 test on the validity of the simulations.
 This was done by plotting frequency responses to, and magnetic field space
 distributions from, direct excitations of the normal modes.
 It was found that they behaved as theoretically predicted and a number
 of points about physical interpretation of the model, for example in the
 non-steady state opposite precession direction modes.
 The results were interpreted in light of the geometry of the samples and
 source configurations and symmetry-induced degeneracies were looked at.
 This is particularly interesting as such degeneracies cannot be detected
 via the other methods.
